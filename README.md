# git-key-grep

Search your git repo for any mistakenly tracked API keys.


## Usage

Inside a git repository, simply run `git key-grep` to find any API keys that
are in the repository (i.e. in any file that is tracked or staged to be
tracked). Matched patterns can be ignored by adding `git-key-grep-ignore`
anywhere on the line (a comment would be a good place).

following in your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```
