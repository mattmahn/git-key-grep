# git-key-grep

Search your Git repo for any mistakenly tracked API keys.


## Usage

Inside a Git repository, simply run `git key-grep` to find any API keys that
are in the repository (i.e. in any file that is tracked or staged to be
tracked). Matched patterns can be ignored by adding `git-key-grep-ignore`
anywhere on the line (a comment would be a good place).

### pre-commit

git-key-grep is compatible with [pre-commit][] with something like the
following in your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:
```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/mattmahn/git-key-grep.git
  sha: HEAD
  hooks:
  - id: git-key-grep
```


## Installation

Dependencies:
- C compiler
- Git
- Make (only for installation)

### Unix

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mattmahn/git-key-grep.git
cd git-key-grep
make
sudo make install
cd ..
rm -rf git-key-grep
```
